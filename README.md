This version of Atari Breakout's remake is deprecated.

A better version is in progress of development.It can be found here - [Link to be added]

This remake is made using JavaScript and the P5js Libraries. Sounds have been taken from freesound.org, the rightful owners of these sounds cannot be identified as a result of the code being too old. If found and identified, the owners of the sounds will be given their due credit.

The images used in this code are as mentioned previously, very old, but are made by the owner of this code (TheMythicalFury@GitHub) and thus the owner retains exclusive rights to use the images.

The repository is divided into 4 folders, along with an 'index.html' in the root folder, which runs the script.

The folders are as follows :
 - JS => Contains all the JavaScript files for the project, the main one being 'sketch.js' and the rest having specific parts of the code, indicated by their names.
 - LIbraries => Contains all the p5JS files used for the project.
 - Pictues => Contains all the pictures used in the project.
 - Sounds=> Contains all the sounds used in the project.
