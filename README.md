This version of Atari Breakout's remake is in progress of development. It will be appreciated immensely if any issues with the code can be bought to notice using the 'Issues' feature in GitHub.

This remake is made using JavaScript and the P5js Libraries.

The repository is divided into 4 folders, along with an 'index.html' in the root folder, which runs the script.

The folders are as follows :
 - JS => Contains all the JavaScript files for the project, the main one being 'sketch.js' and the rest having specific parts of the code, indicated by their names.
 - LIbraries => Contains all the p5JS files used for the project.
 - Pictues => Contains all the pictures used in the project.
 - Sounds=> Contains all the sounds used in the project.
